# :whale: WhaleShow 
## :ticket: Book live shows | :tickets: Trade NFT tickets | :blue_heart: Save the whales

> This is the project submission for NFTHack by @barrasso.

WhaleShow consists of three core components:

**1. :ticket: Auctions:**

Auctions on WhaleShow are attached to actual live events in the real world. 

The winner of an auction receives ownership rights to the show and non-fungible tickets (NFTs:wink:) that can be redeemed for access to the show. The live show happens on a given date, location, and terms that are mutually agreed upon by the winner and the performer. 

Best of all, a portion of the revenue generated from each show goes to non-profits that are actually saving the whales IRL. (e.g. [The Ocean Cleanup](https://theoceancleanup.com/))

**2. :tickets: Trading:**

Tickets can also be bought, sold, and traded on the marketplace.

**3. :ballot_box: Proposals:**

New ideas for shows can be proposed and voted on by the community.
